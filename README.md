# Predicting plant photosynthesis using hyperspectral data with machine learning
The repository contains work of my Master of Data Science capstone project. For the project, I worked with CSIRO and developed a predictive machine learning model to predict plant(flora) photosynthesis from hyper-spectral data. 

## Project abstract
One way to alleviate globle warming is to reduce carbon emission. Since plants (trees) are major sink or carbon on land, it is necessary to accurately track the sink provided by plants. As plants use carbon in photosynthesis process, we can accurately track carbon sink by actively monitoring photosynthetic activity in plants. In the project, I used <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/solar-induced-fluorescence-learn-new-approach-remote-sensing-vegetation">Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF)</a> data to predict photosynthesis function in plants using machine learning techniques. With random forest regressor, I could obtain 86% of R-Squared.
